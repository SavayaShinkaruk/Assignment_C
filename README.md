## Assignment C 
### By: Savaya Shinkaruk 

For my Assignment C. [Individual] Motion Collection project I created a mock blog post that follows the outline of the Coveteur website, and added in a fabricated story with 5 motion graphics. 

My theme for this assignment is a mock Coveteur blog post that has animations in it - which follow the fabricated story I wrote about my sneaker brand merging with Nike. The images, content and animations  follow in the theme of the story being written but also the outline for a Coveteur blog post . For the different sneaker and text motion graphics I used: 
<ul>
<li> CSS Shake (twice)</li>
<li>CSS Transition</li>
<li>SVG Animation (twice)</li>
</ul>

For the CSS Shake animations I placed them into the Gallery (they are the sneaker illustrations I did) and when you hover over them they will shake. This was fun to do! I wanted to add more of these to the page, but I decided to focus on two and add in the CSS transition animation as another option. 

For the CSS Transition animation I placed it into the text of the blog content, and when you hover over the sneaker illustrations (of the three sneakers) i did you will see the blank shoe canvas transform and add colour into the sneaker. This was a simple template to follow. Rather than sizing the 3 images to be in line, I just created a PNG that is 3 sneaker illustrations in 1 image, and then played with the size of the image in the layout. 

For the SVG animations, I did text. It plays on a loop at the top of the page where you see who the article is by (which is an actual Coveteur writer), and text to highlight the Gallery. This follows the theme of it being a blog post. This is the animation I struggled with the most, because I found it tough to figure out how to loop it, but still have it look like the animation was drawing - rather than 'blinking'. This is something I would like to spend more time on to work with and alter a little bit more. 

For later, I would like to update and play more with the container paddings and bring everything in a little more - and make it a little bit more visually appealing like the Coveteur website. But, this is a great start to a portfolio piece!
