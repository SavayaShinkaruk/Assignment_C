# Assignment_C

### By: Savaya Shinkaruk 

For my Assignment C. [Individual] Motion Collection project I created a mock blog post that follows the outline of the Coveteur website, and added in a fabricated story with 5 motion graphics. 

My theme for this assignment is a mock Coveteur blog post that has animations in it - which follow the fabricated story I wrote about my sneaker brand merging with Nike. The images, content and animations  follow in the theme of the story being written but also the outline for a Coveteur blog post . For the different sneaker and text motion graphics I used: 

<li> CSS Shake (twice)</li>
<li>CSS Transition</li>
<li>SVG Animation (twice)</li>


For the CSS Shake animations I placed them into the Gallery (they are the sneaker illustrations I did) and when you hover over them they will shake. 

For the CSS Transition animation I placed it into the text of the blog content, and when you hover over the sneaker illustrations (of the three sneakers) i did you will see the blank shoe canvas transform and add colour into the sneaker. 

For the SVG animations, I did text. It plays on a loop at the top of the page where you see who the article is by (which is an actual Coveteur writer), and text to highlight the Gallery. This follows the theme of it being a blog post.
